### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Pedro, but you can also call me Guto. I'm a Frontend Engineer based in Curitiba, Brazil.

My stack usually contains React with Typescript. I'm excited about anything related to the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem. After-hours, I make side projects to play with new frameworks and libraries. In my latest project, [TinyWins](https://www.tinywinsapp.com/), I had fun playing with [Tamagui](https://tamagui.dev/), using React Native with [Expo](https://expo.dev/).
